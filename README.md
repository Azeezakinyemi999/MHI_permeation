# MHI Permeation Model

Analytical model for hydrogen permeation through oxide-coated structural alloys, built as a hierarchy of increasing physical complexity (Levels 1–6). The active system is **Incoloy 802 (X40 NiCrAlTi 31/19)** with a **Cr₂O₃** surface oxide.

## Quick Start

All entry points are Jupyter notebooks in `Application/`. Open them in order:

| Notebook | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Application/Proposal.ipynb` | Main model walkthrough — Levels 1 through 5 (bulk transport, defective oxide, trapping) |
| `Application/Surface_proposal.ipynb` | Adds Level 6 surface kinetics (chemosorption, Langmuir coverage) |
| `Application/complete_model.ipynb` | Single end-to-end Level 5L6 run showing all resistance paths |
| `Application/model_analysis.ipynb` | Parametric sweeps and regime classification |
| `Application/sensitivity_regime_L5L6.ipynb` | Regime-stratified SA, Level 5L6 — regimes surface / oxide / metal |
| `Application/sensitivity_regime_L5.ipynb` | Regime-stratified SA, Level 5 (no surface kinetics) — regimes oxide / metal / defect |
| `Application/regime_parallel_coords.ipynb` | Parallel-coordinates views of the regime clusters and their sensitivities |

## Model Hierarchy

```
Level 1  — Perfect metal (bulk diffusion + Sieverts solubility)
Level 2a — Perfect oxide layer on metal
Level 2b — Oxide + metal in series
Level 3  — Defective oxide (pinholes, cracks, grain boundaries)
Level 4  — Defective metal (grain boundary enhancement, trapping)
Level 5  — Full system: defective oxide + defective metal
Level 6  — Surface kinetics: dissociation / recombination (Langmuir coverage)
```

Level 5L6 = Level 5 + Level 6 combined.

## Configuration

Active material is set in `calculations/config/model_config.py`.  
To change the metal or oxide, edit the `build_simulation_config()` call at the bottom of that file:

```python
CONFIG = build_simulation_config(
    metal='metal_X40_NiCrAlTi_31_19_Incoloy802_Schmidt1985',
    oxide='Cr2O3_sample4',
)
```

Available metals and oxides are defined in the dicts above that line in the same file.

## Dependencies

- Python ≥ 3.9
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- `SALib` (for sensitivity analysis notebooks only)
- `jupyter` or VS Code with Jupyter extension
