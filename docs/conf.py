"""Sphinx configuration for the MHI permeation model.

Build with:

    conda activate mace_env
    cd docs && make html

Requires ``pip install -e ".[docs]"`` from the repo root. There is deliberately no
``sys.path.insert`` here — PACKAGING_1.0.0.md records several incidents caused by
sys.path manipulation, and this file will not be the next one.

# --- import-time side effects of the package, neutralised before autodoc runs ---

# calculations/sensitivity.py imports matplotlib.pyplot at MODULE level, so every
# autodoc run instantiates a backend. On macOS that resolves to the interactive
# `macosx` backend, which wants a window server. conf.py is executed before any
# autodoc import, which is what makes this work. setdefault, not assignment, so an
# explicit `MPLBACKEND=... make html` still wins.

# The same import triggers matplotlib's font-cache build. Keep it under docs/ so
# the docs never fail on an unwritable $HOME (same reasoning as
# MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/.matplotlib in container/Dockerfile) — but deliberately NOT
# inside _build/, which `make clean` deletes: that would rebuild the font cache
# on every clean build, costing ~15 s and emitting matplotlib log records.
